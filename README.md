## Results
### 2nd submission (Tag 1.1.0)
It is a sad result for our team.  
One of Udacity's requirements, "Stop at traffic lights as needed," was not evaluated.  
The reason is that the traffic light in the testing lot did not work as shown in the figure below.

|Video|rosbag `/image_color`|
|:--:|:--:|

But that is true, and it is a sad result.

### For 2nd submission
We limit the velocity toward the stop line to approximately 10 km/h and improve the detection performance for blurred images.
* Change `MAX_DECEL` from 5.0 to 0.5 in `waypoint_updater.py`.
* Change `real_model.h5` used by `tl_detector.py` (but not included in repository).

### 1st submission (Tag 1.0.0)
The car did not stop even though the traffic light was **red**.  
The cause is that the blurred traffic lights are can not be detected when the velocity exceeds about 10 km/h on the way to `/traffic_waypoint`.

## Submission checklist and requirements
* Launch correctly using the launch files provided in the capstone repo.
* Smoothly follow waypoints in the simulator.
* Respect the target top speed set for the waypoints' `twist.twist.linear.x` in `waypoint_loader.py`.
* Stop at traffic lights when needed.
* Stop and restart PID controllers depending on the state of `/vehicle/dbw_enabled`.
* Publish throttle, steering, and brake commands at 50Hz.

## System Architecture
The following is a system architecture diagram showing the ROS nodes and topics used in the project.
The ROS nodes and topics shown in the diagram are described briefly in the **Code Structure** section below.

## Code Structure
Below is a brief overview of the repo structure, along with descriptions of the ROS nodes.

### (path_to_project_repo)/ros/src/tl_detector/
This package contains the traffic light detection node: `tl_detector.py`.
This node takes in data from the `/image_color`, `/current_pose`, and `/base_waypoints` topics and publishes the locations to stop for red traffic lights to the `/traffic_waypoint` topic.

The `/current_pose` topic provides the vehicle's current position, and `/base_waypoints` provides a complete list of waypoints the car will be following.

We build both a traffic light detection node and a traffic light classification node. Traffic light detection should take place within `tl_detector.py`, whereas traffic light classification should take place within `../tl_detector/light_classification_model/tl_classfier.py`.

![Traffic Light Detection Node](imgs/tl-detector-ros-graph.png)

See code in
[/ros/src/tl_detector/](https://github.com/hidetoshi-furukawa/CarND-Capstone/tree/master/ros/src/tl_detector/).

### (path_to_project_repo)/ros/src/waypoint_updater/
This package contains the waypoint updater node: `waypoint_updater.py`.

![Waypoint Updater Node](imgs/waypoint-updater-ros-graph.png)

See code in [/ros/src/waypoint_updater/](https://github.com/hidetoshi-furukawa/CarND-Capstone/tree/master/ros/src/waypoint_updater/).

### (path_to_project_repo)/ros/src/twist_controller/
Carla is equipped with a drive-by-wire (DBW) system, meaning the throttle, brake, and steering have electronic control.
This package contains the files that are responsible for control of the vehicle: the node `dbw_node.py` and the file `twist_controller.py`.

![DBW Node](imgs/dbw-node-ros-graph.png)

See code in [/ros/src/twist_controller/](https://github.com/hidetoshi-furukawa/CarND-Capstone/tree/master/ros/src/twist_controller/).

#### (path_to_project_repo)/ros/src/styx/
A package that contains a server for communicating with the simulator, and a bridge to translate and publish simulator messages to ROS topics.
#### (path_to_project_repo)/ros/src/styx_msgs/
A package which includes definitions of the custom ROS message types used in the project.
#### (path_to_project_repo)/ros/src/waypoint_loader/
A package which loads the static waypoint data and publishes to `/base_waypoints`.
#### (path_to_project_repo)/ros/src/waypoint_follower/
A package containing code from Autoware which subscribes to `/final_waypoints` and publishes target vehicle linear and angular velocities in the form of twist commands to the `/twist_cmd` topic.

## Traffic Light Detection
### Model for Simulator
We use Tiny YOLOv3 for traffic light detection and classification.

1. Download Tiny YOLOv3 (also called YOLOv3-tiny) weight from [YOLO website](http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)
1. Convert the Darknet YOLO model to a Keras model using [keras-yolo3](https://github.com/hidetoshi-furukawa/keras-yolo3).
1. Transfer learning for traffic light detection.

## Original Instructions
This is the project repo for the final project of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree: Programming a Real Self-Driving Car. For more information about the project, see the project introduction [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/6047fe34-d93c-4f50-8336-b70ef10cb4b2/modules/e1a23b06-329a-4684-a717-ad476f0d8dff/lessons/462c933d-9f24-42d3-8bdc-a08a5fc866e4/concepts/5ab4b122-83e6-436d-850f-9f4d26627fd9).

Please use **one** of the two installation options, either native **or** docker installation.

### Native Installation

* Be sure that your workstation is running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus or Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahir. [Ubuntu downloads can be found here](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
* If using a Virtual Machine to install Ubuntu, use the following configuration as minimum:
  * 2 CPU
  * 2 GB system memory
  * 25 GB of free hard drive space

  The Udacity provided virtual machine has ROS and Dataspeed DBW already installed, so you can skip the next two steps if you are using this.

* Follow these instructions to install ROS
  * [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 16.04.
  * [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 14.04.
* [Dataspeed DBW](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros)
  * Use this option to install the SDK on a workstation that already has ROS installed: [One Line SDK Install (binary)](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/81e63fcc335d7b64139d7482017d6a97b405e250/ROS_SETUP.md?fileviewer=file-view-default)
* Download the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/releases).

### Docker Installation
[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Build the docker container
```bash
docker build . -t capstone
```

Run the docker file
```bash
